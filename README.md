### 1. Short Description
An updated version of Task Manager using functions.

### 2. Installation Section

To install task_manager_2.py and related files please click on the green 'code' button on this page and then click on 'download ZIP'.

### 3. Usage Instructions
This program uses the same while loops and if/ elif/ else statements from Task Manger to navigate the menu.
This time functions have been created to achieve the outputs requested.
As well as the options to add a task, view all tasks, view my tasks, (and for the user 'admin') register a user and view statistics,
there is the additional option to generate reports (again for the user 'admin' only).
Data is kept in separate text files then opened and called when necessary.
Below is a screenshot of some of the information in user_overview.txt:
